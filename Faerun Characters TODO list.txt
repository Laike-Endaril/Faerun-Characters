GUI should open up with Race already selected

Hair color always starts white, and HSV always register it as black

-When you first select a race, the random hair selection needs to go. It causes several issues, not sure if that was just debug or not. Random Skin Tone, Torso style, chest, is fine if none are defined, otherwise whatever it was before is appropriate.

-a sound effect for clicking a button would be good, will provide ogg below.

-Finding what skin was premium is harder to do than it should be. Are we able to take the player to the first panel that is premium and tell them how many premium skins they've chosen? ( they can try again if they picked multiple that's probably fine)

-Clicking "Done" but cant complete, should tell the player what selections are missing.
